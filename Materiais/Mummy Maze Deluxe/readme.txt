1.1 REQUIRED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

MUMMY MAZE Deluxe requires an IBM PC or 100% compatible computer,
with a Pentium II 200 Mhz or better processor. Your computer must have
at least 32 megabytes of RAM.

Operating System: you must be utilizing Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME
with Direct X to play MUMMY MAZE Deluxe on your system.

Controls: a keyboard and a 100% Microsoft compatible mouse are required.

Sound: you must have a Direct X certified sound card installed.

Video: you must have your desktop set to 16-bit or 32-bit Color
(256 Colors will not work).


1.2 RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

PopCap recommends an IBM PC or 100% compatible computer, with a
Pentium II 300 Mhz or better processor.

===================================
2.0 TROUBLESHOOTING / COMPATIBILITY
===================================

For updates to this list go to www.popcap.com.

2.1  Direct X

Mummy Maze requires you to have Direct X drivers installed.
These are sound and video drivers from Microsoft used in
many games. If you need the latest version of Direct X, go to
http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

2.2  Screen Color Depth

Mummy Maze requires you to be running in 16bit color or better. It
may not function in Windowed mode properly in 256 colors. If you
are running in 256 colors, the game will try to switch to full
screen mode.

In addition, the game may run slowly in windowed mode in 32 bit
color. If this occurs, switch to full-screen mode, or change
your color depth to 16 bits.

2.3  Bug Reporting

Though we've tried our best to squash all the bugs, every once in
a while something we didn't expect pops up...

If you should come across a bug in Mummy Maze, please report it to
bugs@popcap.com.

If for some reason the program crashes, it will try to capture any
pertinent data and give you instructions on how to send that data
to PopCap. This is very helpful for tracking down glitches! This 
information is also stored in a file called CRASH.TXT in your
Dynomite directory (C:/PROGRAM FILES/POPCAP GAMES/MUMMY MAZE by
default). If you can, include this text file with any email you
send to PopCap about crashes.

===================
3.0 GETTING STARTED
===================

3.1 GOAL

The goal of Mummy Maze is to make your way through the treacherous
chambers of an Egyptian pyramid to claim the treasure waiting at
the top. The only problem? The pyramid is riddled with traps, 
infested with deadly scorpions, and haunted by relentless mummies.

It'll take all your skill and nerve to outwit the challenges of 
the Mummy Maze!

3.2 GAME TYPES

After the game loads, you will see a screen allowing you to choose
Classic Mode, Adventure, and Tutorial (or to quit back to Windows).
Click on one of these game types to begin playing!

3.3 CLASSIC MODE

This is similar to the web version of Mummy Maze. You must try to
escape from a series of randomly generated mazes of increasing
difficulty. Each time you complete a pyramid of 15 chambers, you
will receive one of 15 treasures.

In Classic mode, your score is calculated based on how quickly you
solve each maze, and how far you can progress before giving up.

When you quit out of Classic mode, your game will automatically be
saved. You can continue it the next time you play by choosing Classic
mode again.

3.4 ADVENTURE 

The Adventure is a new game type exclusive to the Windows version of
Mummy Maze. Here, you must master 15 pyramids full of the most
diabolical hand-crafted mazes we could muster! Conquer the final
pyramid and you will discover the hidden treasures of the Pharaoh
Tutankhamen.

When you begin a new Adventure, you will be prompted to enter a name.
This will be used to identify your Adventure in case someone else at
the same computer starts their own. 

Next, you will see the Adventure Map, a series of 15 pyramids linked
by roads. You must finish all the mazes in a pyramid in order to
unlock the pyramids beyond. However, once you have gained access to a
pyramid, you can move back and forth between it and any other pyramids
you're working on solving.

Click on the pyramid you want to enter, or use the onscreen buttons to
navigate. Once inside, play proceeds as in Classic mode, though you can
use the World Map button to return to this map at any time, to switch
to another pyramid or quit your game.

As in Classic, your game is automatically saved whenever you quit, and
can be continued by selecting Adventure the next time you begin a game.

3.5 TUTORIAL

The Tutorial mode shows you how to play Mummy Maze. If you haven't
played the game before, this should definitely be your first stop!

Even experienced Mummy Maze players may want to check this out, if
you want to find out about a couple of the new twists in store for
you in the Windows version.


================
4.0 INSTRUCTIONS
================

4.1 CONTROLS

Move your explorer by clicking on a square directly adjacent to him.
Diagonal moves are not allowed.

IMPORTANT: to "pass" your turn, click directly on your explorer. This
can often be useful to let the mummy move into a better position.

You can also control your explorer with the arrow keys, and press the
space bar to pass a turn.

4.2 GAMEPLAY

Mummy Maze is a turn-based game. First you move, then the mummy moves,
then it's back to you again.

Your objective in each maze is to make it to the exit without getting
caught by the mummy. 

The problem is that for every one square you move, the mummy moves two!
You need to take advantage of his limited intelligence to trick him
into dead ends and cul-de-sacs.
  
4.3 TRICKING THE MUMMY

The key to fooling the mummy is realizing how it "thinks." 

Normal mummies (the white ones) will always follow the same rules as
they try to catch you:

a) If the mummy can move horizontally (side to side) and get closer
   to your explorer, it will do so.

b) if the mummy can't move horizontally, but can move vertically (up
   and down) and get closer to your explorer, it will do that instead.

Because of these rules, the mummy will often move into dead ends when it
could have caught you by moving a little "smarter." Luckily for you
mummies aren't too smart!

4.4 SCORPIONS

You will also see scorpions in some mazes. These are just as deadly as
mummies, but slower... they can only move 1 square each turn.

If a mummy and a scorpion ever end up in the same square, the mummy will
beat up the scorpion, knocking it out of the game.

4.5 GATES AND KEYS

In some mazes you will see areas blocked off by a gate. These mazes will
also have a key somewhere within. 

The gate can be opened or closed by moving onto the key square.

Remember, the key can be triggered either by you, a mummy, or even a
scorpion! And it can be triggered again, closing the gate, if someone
steps on the key again!

4.6 TRAPS

Some mazes will have traps, which are designated by the skull image on the
floor. If your explorer steps on a trap, he'll meet an unpleasant end...
go ahead, try it out!

However, scorpions and mummies can cross over traps freely, so be careful!

4.7 RED MUMMIES AND SCORPIONS

You may see mummies or scorpions that look different... they're bright red!

These red mummies and scorpions behave differently than the normal ones.
Their priorities for chasing you are reversed... that is, they will try to
get you vertically, before they move horizontally.

In other respects they are identical to normal mummies and scorpions!

4.8 TWO MUMMIES

Some mazes will have 2 mummies in them. In the event that the two mummies
ever collide, they'll get into a fight, with one being destroyed in the process.


===========
5.0 OPTIONS
===========

There are a number of things you can do besides move your explorer, and a
variety of game settings you can change.

5.1 THE SIDEBAR

The sidebar offers a number of important functions.

 UNDO MOVE
   Click this button to "take back" your last move. If you click on it
   repeatedly, it will step you back to the beginning of the level.

 RESET MAZE
   Clicking this button will reset the maze to its initial state. This
   is useful if you get stuck.

 WORLD MAP
   This is disabled in Classic mode, but in the Adventure game it will
   take you to the Adventure map, where you can move to a different
   pyramid you have unlocked.

 MINI MAP
   This is the small pyramid map displayed on the sidebar. It shows your
   progress towards the top of the pyramid, and the treasure you'll find
   if you make it. 

 THE ANKH
   There is a glowing golden Ankh on the right side of the mini map. It
   only appears in certain mazes (mostly easier ones), and its purpose
   is to warn you when the maze can no longer be solved. If the Ankh
   turns red, that means there is no longer any way to complete the maze,
   and you need to reset or undo one or more moves. You can disable the
   Ankh in Options if you like.

 QUIT TO MAIN
   This takes you back to the main menu, where you can start a new game,
   send in your survey information, or quit the program.

There is also an OPTIONS button on the sidebar. Clicking this brings up
a window with a number of game settings you can change.

5.2 IN-GAME OPTIONS

Clicking the OPTIONS button brings up this menu, which lets you change
a number of settings. You can change the volume of the music and sound
effects independently, and alter the speed of the animations in the game
(useful if you find the game moves too slowly for your taste).

You can also set the game to run in Fullscreen mode. The default is the
windowed mode.

If you are having problems with your cursor, you may want to try enabling
the Custom Cursors.

You can enable or disable an onscreen clock, that shows how long you've
taken on the current maze.

You can also enable or disable the Ankh, that turns red when a maze can
no longer be solved. The Ankh is only available on certain levels.

You can also access the Tutorial and High Score screen from here.

Finally, you can register Mummy Maze by clicking the Register button.
See the section on Registration for more information.

===========
6.0 SCORING
===========

You only receive a score in Classic Mode. In Adventure Mode, no score
is given, since you could always master a maze and then start the game
over to maximize your points.

Your score in Classic Mode is based on the difficulty of the maze you solve, and the
amount of time it takes you to solve it. Each successive maze is worth
more points, as is moving to a new pyramid. 

You can gain bonus points for each maze by solving it quickly. These
bonus points will diminish over time, though you will always receive the
base value for each maze you solve.

You receive extra points for collecting the treasure at the top of each
pyramid, and for completing the entire game!

Your high scores will be recorded after you complete your game. You can
also submit them to our web site to compete with other players from
around the world! Both high score options require that you register the
game, however.
